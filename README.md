Code for the paper "Improving Machine Learning Feature Consistency with Stacking Techniques for High-Performance Electrode Materials: Heteroatom Doped Graphene"

The paper has been renamed to "Exploring how base model combination affects the results of a "stacking" ensemble machine learning model: An applied study on optimization of heteroatom doped carbon data"

In the paper highlights section, there is no "moving model" or "brute force" technique, only the "sorting" technique. The brute for is just averaging all the model base model combination results and the moving model is moving the models around and averaging the results. Additionally, the descending method for sorting created the most reliable results for the dataset. I am extremely sorry for any readers that may be confused with the highlights and content of the paper.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my code! While it may not be the most optimized or perfect, I hope it serves as a valuable resource for both beginners and experts. Feel free to use and improve it as you see fit. Your interest and contributions are greatly appreciated.
